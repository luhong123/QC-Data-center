    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Project-The ENCODE Consortium not only produces high-quality data, but also analyzes the data in an integrative fashion. The ENCODE Encyclopedia organizes the most salient analysis products into annotations and provides tools to search and visualize them.\r\norganization-We are a web3 organization named dataup. We help data owner to store data.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "ENCODE investigators employ a variety of assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and annotation of gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA sources, comparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA, i.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We use Lotus to prepare data. We transfer car files to SPs.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://encode-public/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03100009 Hong Kong\r\nf01084941 Hong Kong\r\nf03100002 Shenzhen\r\nf03100000 Shenzhen\r\nf01975299 Shenzhen\r\nf01084413 Changsha\r\nf03161261 New York\r\nf03192503 Hong Kong\r\nf03189917 Dulles",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
